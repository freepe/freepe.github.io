                    <ul class="stars">

                    <h3>FreePe is a joint project</h3>
                    <p>When one million people make together a common project, which includes one million unique ideas - it is much more effective than when each "pulls the blanket over himself," periodically reinventing the wheel.
                        FreePe offers to unite and build a joint project that would satisfy the desires of each participant, allowing full modification of functionality and interface to suit personal needs, as well as
                        helping to solve many questions in one place - from the management of personal finances and, ultimately, the whole infrastructure of the country.</p>               
                    <p>Just imagine for a moment if, instead of a plurality of social networks, search engines, labor exchanges, blokchains - would be a unified versatile network, which includes the best ideas, projects, applications, components, and contains only high-quality products or services, and every user - is a real human. This would allow millions of people to communicate, work, plan, manage, process and resolve all personal and social problems through a universal interface that works on any hardware platform - computer, phone, car or robot. Now, just add here the fact that all this belongs to the users - that is, you!</p>

                    <h3>The operating principle of FreePe</h3>
                    <p>Participants of FreePe network set goals that are necessary for prosperity, which are broken down into tasks. For example, today's goal is to develop decentralized socio-economic network. To do this, perform the tasks in design, development, testing. Human chooses from a list of tasks most appropriate to his/her preferences / talent and begins the implementation of the plan, required to complete the task. During the work, the performer takes into account the time spent and additional costs.</p>
                    <p>After finishing the work, performer tells that he has finished the task and spent exact amount of time using some addition resources. Then experts of same specialization and at least the same level of qualification evaluate the solution . The purpose of their examination is to make certain in adequacy of the declared value of the work. In order to do this, they estimate three parameters:</p>
                <section class="grey-bg">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Reliability - how good and responsibly the work was carried out;</li>
                        <li>fficiency - assessment of performance rate and resource costs;</li>
                        <li>Functionality - the complexity of technology and additional features.</li>                            
                    </ol>
                 </section>
                    <p>Next comes the stage of evaluation of community - ordinary users or customers who evaluate solutions in general: the convenience, aesthetic qualities, etc. When the proposal was liked by at least three unrelated users - it is deemed to be accepted and FreePenny is generated to the performer's wallet.</p>
                    <p>The total cost of the work in the FPN equivalent is formed according to the formula P = r * i * q * h + c, where r - the rating of decency, i - specialization index, of q - qualification of performer in this field of activity, h - the number of hours spent, c - the cost of necessary resources..</p>
